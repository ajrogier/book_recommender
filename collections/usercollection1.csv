"Neuromancer","William Gibson","Neuromancer is the quintessentially definitive cyberpunk novel and a good read into a dark universe, that bears lingering shadows of our own. It's a dark dystopian future that's punctuated with a highly sophisticated technology and where humanity struggles against corporate stratification. In Gibson's debut novel, we learn for the first time about the dark side of a culture based on computer technology. Gibson gave us an early vision of our collective future and his prophecy still haunts us, in films like The Matrix, and television like Altered Carbon."
"The Lord of the Rings","J.R.R. Tolkien","The Lord of the Rings is the ultimate fantasy book, which kicked off the whole of the fantasy genre. The journey from the peace of the shire to the dark crags of Mordor is the definition of epic, and is the best example of modern day mythology. All of the characters are interesting, and the messages of hope still resonate with an audience to this day."
"Dune","Frank Herbert","I read it in the early 70s as a teen. I read Asimov and Heinlein but Dune stuck in my mind chapter by chapter. My son read it in his teens and surpassed my passion of its relations to the present. I'm not here to review, but suggest another author I found intriguing, James Hogan's Inherit the Stars."
"Gardens of the Moon","Steven Erikson","This book and series is not for everyone, but not because you have to be intelligent to like it or anything silly like that. These books, and the series as a whole, employ a non-traditional structure that not everyone will find enjoyable. For those who do, these books will be an awesome, compelling, thought-provoking, humorous and emotional journey. For those who don't, these books will simply be a confusing, frustrating and boring mess. Both perspectives are valid (even for smart people). This series is neither linear nor chronological, and it holds its cards close to the vest. Most fantasy stories will establish several things in the first book, namely the central conflict, the conditions of resolving the conflict, and the stakes. Most stories let you know that the characters have to win freedom, avert evil or war, the end of the world, whatever. How do they do this? By overthrowing the evil king, the dark lord, or the invading army. By learning something, killing something, finding a thing, learning to use a thing or destroying a thing in the fires of Mount Doom, etc. My point is that the reader knows generally where the story is going, and the fun is in the twists and turns of how it gets there. However dark things may look, no one doubts that Frodo will get to Mount Doom, and the one ring will end up in the fires. This series isn't like that. Erikson does NOT identify the central conflict, the conditions of resolution or the stakes until book 10 ( out of 10 books). The reader is simply swept along with the events that are happening and must slowly piece together how they are all connected without knowing where the story is going until you get there. The books will jump around to different characters, in different parts of the world, sometimes skipping forward and back in time, and they will not seem connected until the plot points all converge. Some characters will be important from the beginning of the series to the end. Others will be important for a short time only, influencing and taking part in certain events before dying off or disappearing. Rather than a linear story of what happens to certain characters between point A (the beginning) and point B (the end), this story is a circular tapestry, with separate threads all leading to and converging at the center, which is book 10. Not everyone will enjoy this series, but it's a wild ride for those that do. Book 1 drops you in, gives you very few answers and tons of questions. It can be difficult to get into. It is better than it seems at first though, and although I liked it on my first read, I LOVED in on my second read through."
"The Way of Kings","Brandon Sanderson","I can't recommend this book highly enough. It has all the aspects of Sanderson's writing which have made him my favourite fantasy authour - a fascinating and logical magic system, characters who develop and change (rather than just being a standard RPG character profile), well-paced & gripping plot with stunning twists, and a wonderfully original world (which only forms part of the 'cosmere' inhabited by all his adult fiction). If this series fulfills the promise of its first book, it may well replace Mistborn (which itself supplanted WOT) in the no. 1 spot on my book list."
"The Three-Body Problem","Cixin Liu","To effectively contain a civilization’s development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science. The Three-Body Problem is a very original story, and one that’s rather difficult to describe. Set in the present, in flashbacks against the backdrop of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and at some points in cyberspace, this novel tells a tale of humanity’s first contact with an alien race. I have read reviews stating that The Three-Body Problem feels Chinese. I can’t say whether the book feels Chinese (though it is set there) or whether it’s just this writer’s style. I can say that this book is hard sci-fi, like a Crichton novel on steroids. There are extensive sections in which various physics or computing concepts are laid out. They all serve the plot well, but this style will not be for everyone. Especially since the main weakness of the book is characterization. There is really only one fully developed character (Ye Wenjie), and one entertaining sidekick (Da Shi). Otherwise, the characters are generally passive and largely forgettable. The Three-Body Problem is a plot-driven story about big ideas. I love that it is very pro-science: science is the hope for humanity, and stopping earth’s scientific progress is the goal of our enemies. I can see why it won the Hugo Award for best science-fiction novel. I will definitely read the second book in the trilogy. Recommended, and highly recommended if you enjoy hard sci-fi."
"Foundation","Isaac Asimov","First SF book to capture my imagination, you should read the robots series first as they set the scene. Yet to find the series in Kindle!"

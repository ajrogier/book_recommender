"Neuromancer","William Gibson","I don't think there can be any debate that the visionary nature of this book and it's influence it has had in the cyberpunk genre. however not looking at the wider context and taking this book as is, I found it incredibly difficult to read and enjoy. The language in this book is densely packed and can sometimes be difficult to grasp the concepts being discussed, there doesn't seem to be a whole load of character development and life bought to the characters. I think if you are a fan of the cyberpunk genre and AI, they you will likely love this book, but the genre for me was only an intrigue and it bought me to this book. I wouldn't let me review put you off, it was merely my experience with the book. Many many people enjoy this iconic book."
"The Lord of the Rings","J.R.R. Tolkien","Though it may be one of the most respected, recommended, and beloved book series of all time, Lord of the Rings is that good. Having just finished the last chapter today while tears slowly rolled down my face, I hadn’t realised just how much I enjoyed the series until I didn’t have any more of it to read. Please push past the sheer length of the books, do not let that lead you astray. It only makes you more appreciative of the fact that it is so vast, because when you do read it all and ultimately finish the books, you will only wish to travel to Middle Earth one more time. The story of the ring bearer and his fellowship exceeded all of my expectations. Having watched the films a fair few times, I loved Lord of the Rings anyway, but now I love it even more. The writing is captivating, imaginative, and well-thought-out. Tolkien’s attention to detail and description of the world of Middle Earth and all those that inhabit it is only wavered by the lack of imagination that YOU may have. Please be taken away by this book, because that’s when it is at its best. I couldn’t tell you how many times I read for hours at a time, completely engrossed within the burning and seething plains of Mordor, or the wonderfully sculpted sights of Rivendell. Late into the night or through afternoons and evenings time would fly as I continued to explore and revel in the world that Tolkien has created. Every chapter felt great, new, and meaningful. None were too long and none were too short either, everything feels “just right” about these books. I felt happiness, joy, fear, sadness, despair, amusement, excitement, awe, triumph, admiration, and about everything else in between. Hours of my life that shall never be thought as wasted, and neither will you consider them wasted either."
"Dune","Frank Herbert","Many mediocre sequels followed, but this first is a great piece of political sci-fi. Imagine the oil-producers were extraterrestrial cultures, producing not lubricants and fuels but a natural psychotropic which facilitated hyperspace navigation. Now imagine an Asimovian empire trying to rest control of the source. Imagine that there is a fanatic desert uprising seeking to regain that control, resisted not by the Husseini nor the Ibn Saud but by a royal gang which looks for all the world like the Hapsburgs. Throw in a heroic noble family, political intrigue, brilliant, West-Wing level smartwriting, and just for, the helluvit, a tribe of real witches and some giant snakes which patrol the deserts by tunneling under the sands. Completely addictive read. A modern classic.."
"Dune Messiah","Frank Herbert","Having read the first book and a review of the sequel written by Herbert’s son, I felt some trepidation that I would be disappointed with Messiah. I wasn’t. If you enjoyed Dune (book 1), this second book in the series is every bit as good. The first few pages, although a little slow, give way to a suspenseful development of the plot that doesn’t let up. There are many timeless beautiful philosophical musings that you will want to highlight to reflect on later and apply to our world today."
"Children of Dune","Frank Herbert","Things get weird in Children of Dune. This book is definitely a turning point for the series, and is thus often a point of debate among fans. What's the setup? Minimal spoilers. After the events of Dune Messiah, Paul-Muad'dib is missing and presumed dead. His sister Alia is effectively a religious emperor commanding the universe from Arrakis via Paul's church. Paul's Children Leto and Ghanima become the titular focus of the series. Their prophetic rise to power will define the shape of the universe to come. Children of Dune caps off the tale of Paul-Muad'dib, with the narrative clearly moving to follow other characters. Most fans therefore say that the first 3 books of the Dune series form their own, stand-alone trilogy. You may notice that I'm not really describing a villain or a plot here - I'm sure fans will argue, but there really isn't one. The central conflict of the book is Leto confronting his own future - and that of humanity at large. Can Leto stand up and confront his destiny, or will he take the easy path and doom the universe to a terrible fate? Children of Dune starts to get weird. Not that the first two books were lacking in audacious concepts, but this one has a definite "jump the shark" moment toward the end. I won't spoil anything, but if you thought Paul-Muad'dib was overpowered, Leto takes quite literal leaps and bounds over him.Should you read Children of Dune? It's been a long time since I've read the Dune series, and I'm rereading them now in preparation for the upcoming film. Right now I still stand firmly in the camp of saying it's okay to stop at Dune. Messiah and Children of Dune add a lot more philosophy than plot development, in my opinion. Not everyone who reads Dune is going to want to follow 4+ more books of philosophy and politics, as opposed to the more tech-heavy romp of the first book. It's definitely true that Children of Dune caps off the story of Paul-Muad'dib, so if you really want to see what happens to that character, you should read at least through the end of this book. Should you keep reading past Children of Dune? The most divisive book of the series is up next - God Emperor of Dune. Some say it's impossible, some say it's the greatest book they've ever read. It's worth noting that the series continues much more in the vein of Messiah and Children. The dividing line is whether you're happy with the weird twists that the ending of Children takes. I'm buckled in, and I'll find out how I feel again. But so far my opinion is unchanged - Dune stands on its own, and its sequels are more interesting for people who enjoy thinking about politics and philosophy than for the narrative itself."
"Gardens of the Moon","Steven Erikson"," This book and series is not for everyone, but not because you have to be intelligent to like it or anything silly like that. These books, and the series as a whole, employ a non-traditional structure that not everyone will find enjoyable. For those who do, these books will be an awesome, compelling, thought-provoking, humorous and emotional journey. For those who don't, these books will simply be a confusing, frustrating and boring mess. Both perspectives are valid (even for smart people). This series is neither linear nor chronological, and it holds its cards close to the vest. Most fantasy stories will establish several things in the first book, namely the central conflict, the conditions of resolving the conflict, and the stakes. Most stories let you know that the characters have to win freedom, avert evil or war, the end of the world, whatever. How do they do this? By overthrowing the evil king, the dark lord, or the invading army. By learning something, killing something, finding a thing, learning to use a thing or destroying a thing in the fires of Mount Doom, etc. My point is that the reader knows generally where the story is going, and the fun is in the twists and turns of how it gets there. However dark things may look, no one doubts that Frodo will get to Mount Doom, and the one ring will end up in the fires. This series isn't like that. Erikson does NOT identify the central conflict, the conditions of resolution or the stakes until book 10 ( out of 10 books). The reader is simply swept along with the events that are happening and must slowly piece together how they are all connected without knowing where the story is going until you get there. The books will jump around to different characters, in different parts of the world, sometimes skipping forward and back in time, and they will not seem connected until the plot points all converge. Some characters will be important from the beginning of the series to the end. Others will be important for a short time only, influencing and taking part in certain events before dying off or disappearing. Rather than a linear story of what happens to certain characters between point A (the beginning) and point B (the end), this story is a circular tapestry, with separate threads all leading to and converging at the center, which is book 10. Not everyone will enjoy this series, but it's a wild ride for those that do. Book 1 drops you in, gives you very few answers and tons of questions. It can be difficult to get into. It is better than it seems at first though, and although I liked it on my first read, I LOVED in on my second read through."
"Deadhouse Gates","Steven Erikson","I can't get enough of Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series! DEADHOUSE GATES delivers more of the same excitement and drama, and doesn't let up on the expansion of the hard-to-grasp setting. His characters are some of the most well-developed and sympathetic I've ever come across, each offering a wholly-unique perspective on the fantasy world they live in. As in  Gardens of the Moon , Erikson challenges the reader, revealing snippets of important history and back-story, but leaving his audience somewhat lost feeling. It is hard to keep your bearings when reading these novels, but it only adds to the suspense. Almost like you've been dropped into a strange new world where you don't understand the rules and everything is a surprise. Gradually, though, as you tag along with the characters in these books, you come to get a handle on the setting. The races of people, the system of magic warrens, the geography, the history; they all begin to form a cohesive foundation upon which the rest of the story stands. Some readers have found this almost teasing trickle of information off-putting, but I love the mystery and excitement of gradually putting all the pieces together to figure out what is happening! If you get annoyed by feeling lost in a story, these may not be your cup of tea, but if you're up for a challenge in a incredibly complex setting, this is hard to beat. Book two of the series takes place around a month after the first. For the most part, the events in GARDENS OF THE MOON have very little impact on this new story. A few of the characters have returned, including Kalam, Crokus, Fiddler, and Apsalar/Sorry. Their story centers around attempting to return Apsalar home and maybe assassinating the Empress when done. There are three other major plots, all with loosely-connected characters. Felisin, Heboric, and Baudin are caught up in a destiny that will take them from the slave pits to the center of a revolution. The historian Duiker (one of my favorite viewpoints) follows a desperate retreat across a continent by a harried army trying to protect civilians from slaughter and mayhem. And the non-humans Icarium and Mappo follow their own destinies to confront troubled paths and maybe save the future. Each of these stories is excellent in their own unique ways, and all are emotional roller-coaster rides. The cast of characters in DEADHOUSE GATES is impressive, with the POV characters making up the skeleton, but many more excellent characters filling in the body of the novel (I personally love Coltaine and Apt). Each character is unique and fits a role, with little-to-no needless filler. The overall back-story involves a major rebellion against the Empire in the Seven Cities and a still-mysterious convergence of Ascendants and near-ascendants (D'ivers and Soletaken). This all presents an extremely dangerous setting."
"Memories of Ice","Steven Erikson","It's malazan. It's rad. I read the first two and got halfway through this one before reading the two Rake books currently released. I am on my way back through from Garden of the Moon. I think that's been a great way to read them. It's true, these books are overwhelmingly dense. Reading the first two to get a wide look at the mysteries before going to Rake books to get some mystery revealed while informing a lot of our knowledge of the goings on of the Malazan books and then getting a refresher on the characters before forging ahead has been one of my top 3 reading experiences."
"The Way of Kings","Brandon Sanderson","I can't recommend this book highly enough. It has all the aspects of Sanderson's writing which have made him my favourite fantasy authour - a fascinating and logical magic system, characters who develop and change (rather than just being a standard RPG character profile), well-paced & gripping plot with stunning twists, and a wonderfully original world (which only forms part of the 'cosmere' inhabited by all his adult fiction). If this series fulfills the promise of its first book, it may well replace Mistborn (which itself supplanted WOT) in the no. 1 spot on my book list."
"Words of Radiance","Brandon Sanderson","My biggest complaint about Words of Radiance is actually directly connected with its biggest strength. It is a massive tome - a sprawling behemoth of a book, and as a result we get to see more of Roshar than ever before. More of its politics, its mysteries, its religions, its cultures, its landscapes, its magic. Thank God for that, since I love this world and I never want to leave. But Sanderon's pacing here is...well, off. (The witty banter is also painful to read, at times, but it adds to the charm of the characters, in its own weird way.)"
"The Three-Body Problem","Cixin Liu","To effectively contain a civilization’s development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science. The Three-Body Problem is a very original story, and one that’s rather difficult to describe. Set in the present, in flashbacks against the backdrop of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and at some points in cyberspace, this novel tells a tale of humanity’s first contact with an alien race. I have read reviews stating that The Three-Body Problem feels Chinese. I can’t say whether the book feels Chinese (though it is set there) or whether it’s just this writer’s style. I can say that this book is hard sci-fi, like a Crichton novel on steroids. There are extensive sections in which various physics or computing concepts are laid out. They all serve the plot well, but this style will not be for everyone. Especially since the main weakness of the book is characterization. There is really only one fully developed character (Ye Wenjie), and one entertaining sidekick (Da Shi). Otherwise, the characters are generally passive and largely forgettable. The Three-Body Problem is a plot-driven story about big ideas. I love that it is very pro-science: science is the hope for humanity, and stopping earth’s scientific progress is the goal of our enemies. I can see why it won the Hugo Award for best science-fiction novel. I will definitely read the second book in the trilogy. Recommended, and highly recommended if you enjoy hard sci-fi."
